Release Notes
=============

See the :ref:`upgrading instructions <upgrading>` for information on upgrading Flocker clusters from earlier releases.
If you have a Vagrant tutorial environment from a previous release see :ref:`upgrading-vagrant-environment`.

You can learn more about where we might be going with future releases by:

* Stopping by the ``#clusterhq`` channel on ``irc.freenode.net``.
* Visiting our GitHub repository at https://github.com/ClusterHQ/flocker.

v1.0.3
======

* On Ubuntu-14.04, log files are now written to /var/log/flocker and rotated in five 100MiB files, so as not fill up the system disk. 

v1.0.2
======

* On CentOS 7, Flocker logs are no longer written to /var/log/messages since this filled up disk space too quickly.
  The logs are still available via journald.
* The "on-failure" and "always" restart policies for containers have been temporarily disabled due to poor interaction with node reboots for containers with volumes (FLOC-2467).
  See :ref:`restart policy<restart configuration>`.

v1.0.1
======

Upgrading is strongly recommended for all users of v1.0.0.

* The EBS storage driver now more reliably selects the correct OS device file corresponding to an EBS volume being used.
* Additional safety checks were added to ensure only empty volumes are formatted.
* ClusterHQ Labs projects, including the Flocker Docker Plugin and an experimental Volumes CLI and GUI are now documented in the :ref:`Labs section <labs-projects>`.

v1.0
====

* Dataset backend support for :ref:`AWS Elastic Block Storage (EBS)<aws-dataset-backend>`, :ref:`OpenStack Cinder<openstack-dataset-backend>`, and :ref:`EMC ScaleIO and XtremIO<emc-dataset-backend>`.
* Third parties can write Flocker storage drivers so that their storage systems work with Flocker.
  See :ref:`dataset-backend-plugins`.
* It is now necessary to specify a dataset backend for each agent node.
  See :ref:`post-installation-configuration`.
* Flocker-initiated communication is secured with TLS.
  See :ref:`authentication`.
* ``flocker-deploy`` now requires the hostname of the control service as its first argument.
* Added REST API functions to manage containers in a cluster alongside datasets.
  See :ref:`api`.
* Removed support for installing ``flocker-node`` on Fedora 20.
* Ubuntu CLI installation instructions now use Debian packages instead of pip packaging.
  See :ref:`installing-flocker-cli-ubuntu`.
* Bug fixes and improvements focused on security and stability across platforms.

v0.4
====

* New :ref:`REST API<api>` for managing datasets.
* Applications can now be configured with a :ref:`restart policy<restart configuration>`.
* Volumes can now be configured with a :ref:`maximum size<volume configuration>`.
* Documentation now includes :ref:`instructions for installing flocker-node on CentOS 7<centos-7-install>`.
* SELinux must be disabled before installing Flocker.
  A future version of Flocker may provide a different integration strategy.

v0.3.2
======

* Documented how to configure the Fedora firewall on certain cloud platforms.


v0.3.1
======

* Applications can now be :ref:`configured with a CPU and memory limit<configuration>`.
* Documentation now includes instructions for installing flocker-node on Fedora 20.
* Documentation now includes instructions for deploying ``flocker-node`` on three popular cloud services: :ref:`Amazon EC2<aws-install>`, :ref:`Rackspace<rackspace-install>`, and DigitalOcean.


v0.3
====

* ``geard`` is no longer used to manage Docker containers.
* Added support for `Fig`_ compatible :ref:`application configuration <fig-compatible-config>` files.


v0.2
====

* Moving volumes between nodes is now done with a :ref:`two-phase push<clustering>` that should dramatically decrease application downtime when moving large amounts of data.
* Added support for environment variables in the :ref:`application configuration<configuration>`.
* Added basic support for links between containers in the :ref:`application configuration<configuration>`.

v0.1
====

Everything is new since this is our first release.
