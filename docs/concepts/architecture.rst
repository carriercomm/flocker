Flocker Cluster Architecture
============================

This document describes the Flocker cluster's architecture.
More accurately, it describes the architecture Flocker is moving towards, a transition that is still in progress.

The Flocker cluster is composed of two sets of services:

1. **The control service** that you can interact with using a :ref:`HTTP API<api>` to modify the desired configuration of the cluster.
2. **Convergence agents** in charge of modifying the cluster state to match the desired configuration.
   For example, if you're using Flocker's ZFS storage backend you will have ZFS-specific agents running on each node in the cluster.


Control service
===============

The control service is the integration point between:

* the human administrators or automated orchestration framework which determine the cluster configuration, and
* the convergence agents that modify the cluster state accordingly.

The service consists of three components:

* An external API allowing changes to the desired configuration, e.g. "create a new dataset on node A".
  The external API also allows checking the actual state of the cluster.
* An internal API used to communicate with the convergence agents.
* A data storage system stores the configuration of the system.

All three are encapsulated in a single server, for the moment limited to running on a single machine.


Convergence agents
==================

Convergence agents ensure that the state of the cluster eventually converges with the configuration.
They control the actual system state but cannot modify the configuration.

Each agent is solely responsible for some particular piece of state in the cluster, its local state.
Some convergence agents may be in charge of state related to a specific node, e.g. a ZFS agent may be in charge of ZFS datasets on node A.
Others may be in charge of some cluster-wide state.
Multiple agents may run on a specific node depending on the cluster setup.

Each convergence agent runs a loop to converge the local state it manages with the desired cluster configuration managed by the control service.
The agent:

#. Checks the local state it is in charge of (e.g. by listing local ZFS filesystems).
#. Notifies the control service of the local state.
#. Calculates the actions necessary to make local state match desired configuration.
#. Executes these actions.
#. Starts the loop again.

For example, imagine the control service notifies the agent on node A that node A should have dataset D, and that as far as it knows no dataset D exists in the cluster.

#. The agent discovers there are no datasets on the node.
#. The agent tells the control service that there exist no datasets on the node.
   The agent always reports its latest local state to the control service to ensure it is up-to-date, even if it may change in near future.
#. The agent decides it needs to create dataset D, and does so.
#. The loop begins again - the agent discovers that dataset D exists on the node.
#. The agent tells the control service that dataset D exists on the node.
#. The agent sees that the node state matches the desired configuration, and realizes it doesn't need to do anything.
#. Etc.
